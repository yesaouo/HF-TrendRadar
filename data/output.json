However, not because the Moon landings didn't happen. It is only because of the optical limitations of telescopes themselves, because of their limited size and distance from the Moon.\nand here is another\nThe outer Solar System is more richly endowed with moons than the inner regions. The two enormous gas giant planets, Jupiter and Saturn, and the ice giant planets, Uranus and Neptune, have numerous moons of various sizes, shapes, and origins. As these enormous planets grew, during the early days of our Solar System, they were able to ensnare wandering objects with their mighty gravitational grips.\nPlanetary scientists believed for years that Earth's Moon is depleted of water and other volatile compounds. However, this idea began to change in 2008, when a team of scientists announced that they had detected traces of water in some of the volcanic glass beads carried back to Earth from the Apollo 15 and 17 missions to the Moon. In 2011, additional study of extremely small crystalline formations within those beads revealed that they contain amounts of water that are similar to some basalts on Earth. This indicates that the lunar mantle--at least, part of it--contains as much water as Earth's.\n- Biggest Volcano In The Solar System\n- Cool Pictures Of The Planet Mars\n- NASA Comet Track\n- Landscape in Other Planets\n- Distance Between the Solar System\n- Eagle Nebula Star Birth\n- Johannes Kepler Kepler NASA Mission\n- The Water Planet Company\n- Days to Mars\n- River Song Astronaut Outfit\n- NASA Mentoring Program\n- Blue Nebula Background\n- Gold Nebula\n- Mars Lander Valley of the Moon\n- Gliese 581 G\nThere are ongoing studies assessing the past habitability potential of the Red Planet, as well as the possibility of life.\nThe research published in the July 4, 2016 issue of Nature Geoscience highlights the main factor differentiating moon-birth around Mars and Earth: the differing rotation speeds of the two planets prompted \"completely different tidal actions,\" Dr. Charnoz explained in the July 4, 2016 CNRS Press Release. Dr. Charnoz proposes that at the time of their respective impacts, \"Earth took less than four hours to spin on its axis whereas Mars rotated very slowly over a 24-hour period.\" The result of this important difference caused Earth to hold on to its single, large Moon, while the Martian collision created a dozen smaller moons alongside a larger moon. As time went by, Martian tidal action--resulting from the planet's slow rotation rate--caused most of the moons, including the largest one, to crash back down to the surface of their parent-planet. As a result, only the two most distant moons, Phobos and Deimos, survived as testimony to the ancient catastrophe.\nMost of Saturn's natural satellites are very small and icy dancing moonlets. However, the larger, icy midsized moons twirl around their enormous ringed planet in a lovely and mysterious dance. The largest of the icy moons is Rhea, Saturn's second-largest moon after the weird world that is Titan. Iapetus, the third largest of Saturn's moons, is two-faced, with one side composed of gleaming, very bright, highly reflective ice, and the other, dark and non-reflective, a blackened splotch staining the pristine white ice. Iapetus is larger than Mimas and Enceladus. There is an enormous impact crater on the moon Mimas, that stands out as a prominent feature on what is apparently a badly bombarded, heavily cratered world. The large impact crater Herschel on this 400-kilometer moon was excavated by a tumbling chunk of space-stuff made of rock, ice, or both, that came very close to powdering the entire little moon. Another icy moon, Enceladus, is a bewitching world, 500-kilometers in diameter, that is thought to harbor a global subsurface ocean beneath its frozen crust. Where there is liquid water there is always the possibility--though, by no means, the promise--of life. Enceladus also has the highest albedo of any other moon in our Solar System. This means that it has the most dazzlingly bright reflective surface. It also possesses a very active geology, rendering it almost free of craters because it is constantly being resurfaced by the emissions of gushing icy geysers that are responsible for fresh snow that keeps the surface of the little moon sparkling and smooth.",

The product portfolio includes the UR5 and UR10 models that handle payloads of up to 11.3 lbs. and 22.6 lbs. respectively. The six-axis robot arms weigh as little as 40 lbs. with reach capabilities of up to 51 inches. Repeatability of +/- .004\" allows quick precision handling of even microscopically small parts. After initial risk assessment, the collaborative Universal Robots can operate alongside human operators without cumbersome and expensive safety guarding. This makes it simple and easy to move the light-weight robot around the production, addressing the needs of agile manufacturing even within small- and medium sized companies regarding automation as costly and complex. If the robots come into contact with an employee, the built-in force control limits the forces at contact, adhering to the current safety requirements on force and torque limitations. Intuitively programmed by non-technical users, the robot arms go from box to operation in less than an hour, and typically pay for themselves within 195 days. Since the first UR robot entered the market in 2009, the company has seen substantial growth with the robotic arms now being sold in more than 50 countries worldwide.",

Please contact Records Management Division\nAccident occurred Wednesday, August 23, 2000 in NEWBERRYPORT, MA\nProbable Cause Approval Date: 04/06/2001\nAircraft: Aviat A-1B, registration: N475C\nInjuries: 2 Uninjured.\nNTSB investigators may have traveled in support of this investigation and used data provided by various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.\nThe pilot reported that he performed a wheel landing with a 90-degree crosswind from the left of about 8 knots. As the tail wheel was being lowered and the flaps raised, the airplane became 'squirrelly'. The pilot added power for a 'go-around', and the airplane departed the right side of the runway. The airplane continued for 345 feet, until it struck a parked airplane. According to the FAA, the airplane departed the runway at a 30-degree angle and continued for 345 feet, until it struck a parked airplane. Continuous tire tracks from the airplane were observed from the runway to the accident site. A pilot rated passenger reported that he told the front seat pilot to cut the power when the airplane departed the runway. However there was no response, and he closed the throttle before impact.\nThe National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: the failure of the pilot to maintain directional control during landing and a subsequent rejected landing. Factors were the crosswind, and the delayed corrective action by the pilot. Full narrative available\nIndex for Aug2000 | Index of months",

            "question": "What is a one-sentence summary of the following article?\nOne of the first complaints presented to doctors by many people later diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease is an involuntary tremor or shaking of the hands, fingers, arms, legs, jaw, and face. You’re most likely to notice this tremor when your hands are at rest rather than when you’re using them, although you may see more tremors while your hands and arms are in use as the disease progresses.  There are many causes of tremors. Parkinson's Disease is one of the most common causes, and tremors are often the first sign of the disease. The tremor and other symptoms may initially appear only on one side of the body, or they may appear worse on one side than the other. A repetitive “pill-rolling\" movement between the thumb and finger—named because it looks as though the person is rolling a pill between their fingers—is characteristic of a Parkinsonian tremor. Some symptoms of Parkinson's are caused by the larger symptom of slowed movements (also known as bradykinesia). This primarily affects motor functions from walking and balance to writing and even motor functions that are often considered reflexive or spontaneous.  These slowed movements are a very common early sign of Parkinson’s, and may show up at the onset of the disease in 80% of patients. Some people might have a hard time describing what they are feeling and use words like “weakness,” “tiredness,” or “incoordination” when talking about these symptoms. Look for distortions in voluntary movements. In addition to involuntary movements, those with Parkinson’s may experience disturbances in their voluntary movements beyond just slowness. Some of the treatments used for Parkinson's disease may cause abnormal involuntary movements, or an increase in movement, referred to as dyskinesia. These distortions (dyskinesias) can be similar to a “tic” in appearance and worsen with psychological stress. Advanced dyskinesia is most often seen in patients who have been on the medication Levodopa for some time. A common symptom of Parkinson’s is a shuffling gait with short steps and a tendency to lean forward. People with Parkinson's often have difficulty with their balance, and there is sometimes a tendency to fall forward, causing the person to walk faster and faster to keep from falling over. This pattern is called a \"festinating gait,\" and it is very common in Parkinson's disease. This symptom typically shows up in the later stages of the disease. Those with Parkinson’s Disease often lean forward at the waist when standing or walking. This is because Parkinson's can cause posture and balance problems, including rigidity. There is a tendency to flex the arms and the head so that the person appears bent over with the elbows flexed and the head down.  Rigidity can affect the whole body, and might you feel stiff or sore. Check for postural rigidity. Also referred to as “cog-wheeling,” this symptom presents as a hallmark, rigid motion when an examiner moves the arm of a patient through basic flexion and extension motions. The rigidity and resistance to movement is most obvious with passive movement of the wrists and elbow. Cog-wheeling may happen when the increased muscle tone related to rigidity is combined with a tremor. Some cognitive impairment is common, but usually not until late in the course of the disease. Around 90% of those with PD will show signs of speech disturbances at some point. These can present as quieter speech, breathy or hoarse qualities to the voice, and reduced precision with language. The voice often becomes soft or whispery because the vocal muscles lack mobility. Up to 60% of those with PD may show signs or anxiety or depression. PD affects some of the mood-stabilizing portions of the brain, which leads to this increased chance for depression, especially paired with the quality of life for patients in late stages of the disease. The muscles used to push food through the digestive system are also affected by PD. This can lead to a variety of gastrointestinal issues from incontinence to constipation. These same symptoms often present along with difficulty swallowing food as well. Many of the involuntary movements associated with Parkinson’s make it increasingly difficult for those with the disease to get a full night of sleep. Other symptoms—such as muscle rigidity making it difficult to roll over at night or bladder issues leading to getting up at night to urinate frequently—compound the sleep disruptions experienced by those with PD.\n\nSummary:",
            "response": "Involuntary tremors, slowed movements, and posture and balance issues are common early symptoms of Parkinson's Disease, often accompanied by disturbances in voluntary movements, speech, mood, and gastrointestinal issues as the disease progresses."

            "text": "\"Monopsony\" refers to a market structure where there is only one buyer for a particular good or service. In economics, this term is particularly relevant in the labor market, where a monopsony employer has significant power over the wages and working conditions of their employees. The presence of a monopsony can result in lower wages and reduced employment opportunities for workers, as the employer has little incentive to increase wages or provide better working conditions.\n\nRecent research has identified potential monopsonies in industries such as retail and fast food, where a few large companies control a significant portion of the market (Bivens & Mishel, 2013). In these industries, workers often face low wages, limited benefits, and reduced bargaining power, leading to a situation where they are dependent on the employer for their livelihood. This dependence can result in further suppression of wages and a decline in working conditions.\n\nOverall, the concept of monopsony is essential to understanding the dynamics of labor markets and the impact of market power on workers. Further research is needed to understand the extent and impact of monopsonies on the economy and to develop policies to address this issue.\n\nReferences:\nBivens, J., & Mishel, L. (2013).

This results in a situation where the employer has the ability to suppress wages and reduce the bargaining power of workers.\n\nResearch has shown that the existence of monopsony power in labor markets can have negative effects on workers, such as lower wages, reduced benefits, and limited job opportunities. For example, a study by Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2013) found evidence of monopsony power in certain U.S. labor markets, resulting in lower wages and reduced job opportunities for workers. Similarly, another study by Bharadwaj, Black, and Kolesnikova (2019) found that the presence of a single dominant employer in a local labor market was associated with lower wages for workers.",

            "text": "Here are some potential regulatory options to address monopsony power over employees:\n\n- Antitrust enforcement agencies like the FTC or DOJ could investigate and take action against dominant employers that are abusing their market power to suppress wages or worsen working conditions. They could force divestitures or other structural remedies.\n- Labor standards agencies could set industry-specific minimum wage floors or other regulations around compensation and working conditions. This would reduce the ability of dominant employers to push wages/conditions below certain thresholds.\n- Sector-specific regulators could impose requirements around how companies hire, compensate, and treat workers. For example, banking regulators could prohibit abusive practices by dominant banks with regard to their employees.\n- Legislatures could pass laws",

            "text": "Regulatory intervention can be used to address the negative consequences of monopsony power in the labor market. A few options include:\n\n1. Antitrust enforcement: Antitrust laws can be used to prevent firms from engaging in practices that limit competition and suppress wages. The antitrust division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) are responsible for enforcing these laws.\n\n2. Labor standards and protections: Governments can set minimum wage standards and other labor protections to ensure that workers are paid a fair wage, even in industries dominated by a single buyer. The U.S. Department of Labor is responsible for enforcing these standards.\n\n3. Occupational licensing reform: Occupational licensing requirements can restrict worker mobility and increase the bargaining power of employers. Reforms to licensing requirements can reduce these barriers and increase competition in the labor market. State governments typically regulate occupational licensing.\n\n4. Collective bargaining rights: Collective bargaining by workers can increase their bargaining power and lead to higher wages. Governments can protect and promote collective bargaining rights to counteract the effects of monopsony power. The National Labor Relations Board is responsible for enforcing workers' rights to engage in collective bargaining in the U.S.\n\nThese are just a few examples of regulatory options that can be used to address monopsony power in the labor market. The specific actions taken will depend on the particular circumstances and context of each case.",
