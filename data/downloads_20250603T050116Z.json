However, not because the Moon landings didn't happen. It is only because of the optical limitations of telescopes themselves, because of their limited size and distance from the Moon.\nand here is another\nThe outer Solar System is more richly endowed with moons than the inner regions. The two enormous gas giant planets, Jupiter and Saturn, and the ice giant planets, Uranus and Neptune, have numerous moons of various sizes, shapes, and origins. As these enormous planets grew, during the early days of our Solar System, they were able to ensnare wandering objects with their mighty gravitational grips.\nPlanetary scientists believed for years that Earth's Moon is depleted of water and other volatile compounds. However, this idea began to change in 2008, when a team of scientists announced that they had detected traces of water in some of the volcanic glass beads carried back to Earth from the Apollo 15 and 17 missions to the Moon. In 2011, additional study of extremely small crystalline formations within those beads revealed that they contain amounts of water that are similar to some basalts on Earth. This indicates that the lunar mantle--at least, part of it--contains as much water as Earth's.\n- Biggest Volcano In The Solar System\n- Cool Pictures Of The Planet Mars\n- NASA Comet Track\n- Landscape in Other Planets\n- Distance Between the Solar System\n- Eagle Nebula Star Birth\n- Johannes Kepler Kepler NASA Mission\n- The Water Planet Company\n- Days to Mars\n- River Song Astronaut Outfit\n- NASA Mentoring Program\n- Blue Nebula Background\n- Gold Nebula\n- Mars Lander Valley of the Moon\n- Gliese 581 G\nThere are ongoing studies assessing the past habitability potential of the Red Planet, as well as the possibility of life.\nThe research published in the July 4, 2016 issue of Nature Geoscience highlights the main factor differentiating moon-birth around Mars and Earth: the differing rotation speeds of the two planets prompted \"completely different tidal actions,\" Dr. Charnoz explained in the July 4, 2016 CNRS Press Release. Dr. Charnoz proposes that at the time of their respective impacts, \"Earth took less than four hours to spin on its axis whereas Mars rotated very slowly over a 24-hour period.\" The result of this important difference caused Earth to hold on to its single, large Moon, while the Martian collision created a dozen smaller moons alongside a larger moon. As time went by, Martian tidal action--resulting from the planet's slow rotation rate--caused most of the moons, including the largest one, to crash back down to the surface of their parent-planet. As a result, only the two most distant moons, Phobos and Deimos, survived as testimony to the ancient catastrophe.\nMost of Saturn's natural satellites are very small and icy dancing moonlets. However, the larger, icy midsized moons twirl around their enormous ringed planet in a lovely and mysterious dance. The largest of the icy moons is Rhea, Saturn's second-largest moon after the weird world that is Titan. Iapetus, the third largest of Saturn's moons, is two-faced, with one side composed of gleaming, very bright, highly reflective ice, and the other, dark and non-reflective, a blackened splotch staining the pristine white ice. Iapetus is larger than Mimas and Enceladus. There is an enormous impact crater on the moon Mimas, that stands out as a prominent feature on what is apparently a badly bombarded, heavily cratered world. The large impact crater Herschel on this 400-kilometer moon was excavated by a tumbling chunk of space-stuff made of rock, ice, or both, that came very close to powdering the entire little moon. Another icy moon, Enceladus, is a bewitching world, 500-kilometers in diameter, that is thought to harbor a global subsurface ocean beneath its frozen crust. Where there is liquid water there is always the possibility--though, by no means, the promise--of life. Enceladus also has the highest albedo of any other moon in our Solar System. This means that it has the most dazzlingly bright reflective surface. It also possesses a very active geology, rendering it almost free of craters because it is constantly being resurfaced by the emissions of gushing icy geysers that are responsible for fresh snow that keeps the surface of the little moon sparkling and smooth.",

The six-axis robot arms weigh as little as 40 lbs. with reach capabilities of up to 51 inches. Repeatability of +/- .004\" allows quick precision handling of even microscopically small parts. After initial risk assessment, the collaborative Universal Robots can operate alongside human operators without cumbersome and expensive safety guarding. This makes it simple and easy to move the light-weight robot around the production, addressing the needs of agile manufacturing even within small- and medium sized companies regarding automation as costly and complex. If the robots come into contact with an employee, the built-in force control limits the forces at contact, adhering to the current safety requirements on force and torque limitations. Intuitively programmed by non-technical users, the robot arms go from box to operation in less than an hour, and typically pay for themselves within 195 days.

Please contact Records Management Division\nAccident occurred Wednesday, August 23, 2000 in NEWBERRYPORT, MA\nProbable Cause Approval Date: 04/06/2001\nAircraft: Aviat A-1B, registration: N475C\nInjuries: 2 Uninjured.\nNTSB investigators may have traveled in support of this investigation and used data provided by various sources to prepare this aircraft accident report.\nThe pilot reported that he performed a wheel landing with a 90-degree crosswind from the left of about 8 knots. As the tail wheel was being lowered and the flaps raised, the airplane became 'squirrelly'. The pilot added power for a 'go-around', and the airplane departed the right side of the runway. The airplane continued for 345 feet, until it struck a parked airplane. According to the FAA, the airplane departed the runway at a 30-degree angle and continued for 345 feet, until it struck a parked airplane. Continuous tire tracks from the airplane were observed from the runway to the accident site. A pilot rated passenger reported that he told the front seat pilot to cut the power when the airplane departed the runway. However there was no response, and he closed the throttle before impact.\nThe National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: the failure of the pilot to maintain directional control during landing and a subsequent rejected landing. Factors were the crosswind, and the delayed corrective action by the pilot. Full narrative available\nIndex for Aug2000 | Index of months",
